   <h3> Course Description </h3>

     <p> COMM 2024, Media Writing, covers several aspects that any future
     journalist needs to know. From writing press releases, to opinion
   pieces for a news outlet, or conducting a question and answer interview with
   a media professional. This class covers all of these aspects, while operating
   under the AP style guide for technical wrtiting. In operating under this high
 level of scruntiny, great attention to detail must be enforced and this class
teaches you to maintain a sharp focus and think outside of the box to get the best
possible story written. </p>

       <h3> Teacher's Bio / Interests </h3>

       <p> Professor Jenkins enjoys reading, editing professional papers and
       watching the University of North Carolina Tar Heels in his spare time.
     Outside of that, he has spends much of his time reading, watching the news
   in an effort to stay up to date and educate the class as young journalists and
 he also edits professional works as well. </p>


       <h3> My Opinion </h3>

       <p>This class is challenging to say the least, but provides great life
       skills for those interested in a journalistic career. Having the knowledge
     and capabilities to effectively write for the mass media is incredibly
   important and will be a transferrable skill to any organization in which
 we become a part of following graduation. Furthermore, the sharp focus and detail
 not only applies to writing, but most work that we do.</p>
