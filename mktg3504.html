   <h3> Course Description </h3>

     <p> MKTG 3504 covers several different aspects of advertising in today's

   growth and a deeper udnerstanding of what it takes to be a successful member of
   an advetising or marketing agency. Taking the time to know not only the numbers

   were developed and how to create your own successful campaigns is very
   important.   </p>
