     <h2> Dr. Evia </h2>

   <h3> Course Description </h3>

     <p> In COMM 2034, we have covered many different aspects of visual media
       throughout the semester. Each portion of this class is broken into
       "modules" covering different topics. These have included: design, photo,
       video and building a web presence. All of these skills we be very important
     as we look to the future and take jobs in different sectors. All of these
   companies will likely expect us to have a working knowledge of different aspects
 of design and web presence. Overall, these skills are a good asset in general, as
they can be used to great designs for family and friends.  </p>

       <h3> My Opinion </h3>

       <p>So far, I have very much enjoyed this class and feel that I have
         gained many important skills that will be extremely useful to me
         as I continue my professional career. When going into a job, they will
         expect me to have a working knowledge of systems in the Adobe Cloud
         and this class has allowed me to gain those skills. </p>
